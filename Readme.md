# TinyWiki

Sometimes it is difficult to find information for something you want quickly. If you are someone who likes Wikipedia but dislikes manually searching for information you need then TinyWiki is for you! TinyWiki allows you to search for a topic you need some information about and searches for information on that topic in Wikipedia for you.

## To run this on your system 
You need to run server and client seperately to get this build working, for server 

```
cd TinyWiki/server
npm i
npm start
```
for client : 
```
cd TinyWiki/client
npm i
npm start
```
here are the credentials for admin login criteria 
```
email : superuser
password: Admin
```
